## Issue Guidelines

### Before Creating an Issue

1. Check if the issue already exists
2. Search through closed issues
3. Check the documentation

### Issue Templates

Use the provided issue templates for:
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Documentation improvements

## Coding Standards

### Java/Kotlin Style

- Follow Android's official style guide
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add Javadoc comments for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and small
- Use proper exception handling

### Code Formatting

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use camelCase for variables and methods
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants

### Example

```java
/**
 * Gets the current accurate time from NTP servers.
 * 
 * @return Date object representing the current accurate time
 * @throws IllegalStateException if TrueTime is not initialized
 */
public static Date now() {
    if (!isInitialized()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("You need to call init() on TrueTime at least once.");
    }
    // Implementation...
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Use descriptive test method names
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### Integration Tests

- Test the library with the sample app
- Verify NTP functionality works correctly
- Test on different Android versions and devices

### Test Structure

```java
@Test
public void testTrueTimeInitialization_WithValidServer_ShouldSucceed() {
    // Given
    String ntpServer = "time.google.com";
    
    // When
    TrueTime.build().initialize(ntpServer);
    
    // Then
    assertTrue(TrueTime.isInitialized());
    assertNotNull(TrueTime.now());
}
```

## Release Process

Releases are managed through GitHub releases and JitPack:

1. Update version numbers in build.gradle files
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a release tag
4. JitPack automatically builds and publishes the release
